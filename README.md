# RecipeBook App - Flutter

## _About this Application_

> _The RecipeBook App is suitable for the health conscious users with providing recipes which can be allergy free to them with several important features. Users will have to register and login to the app using email address and password, once done users may browse through recipes by different categories and then view the detailed cooking method and its necessary ingredients. Users may add recipes to favourites and remove them from the list. Other than that, users can utilise the kitchen timer to easily track cooking intervals, and the BMI calculator for the ones who are health conscious. Users can identify what BMI values to supervise and in case they need to visit a doctor for advice if abnormal results are shown._
